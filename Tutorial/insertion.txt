Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] . 2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. 3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor,Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
